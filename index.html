            (its creation will be explained later on in this infographic) will remove the oxygen, leaving just pure Iron behind to
            be used in manufacturing industries.

                <p>Method of use:
                <br><br> Iron (III) Oxide is poured into a blast furnace along with coke (pure Carbon). When this happens, once the furnace turns on,
                the hot air will combine its oxygen molecules with the Carbon to form Carbon Dioxide. Eventually, once enough Carbon Dioxide has formed,
                when the remaining Coke is poured into the furnace, it mixes with the created Carbon Dioxide, and reduces it to Carbon (method called 'reduction').

                <br><br> The Carbon Monoxide then reacts with the Iron (III) Oxide to produce pure Iron and Carbon Dioxide gas, with Oxygen now
                being completely removed from the Iron. </p>

                    This newly formed Iron will then collect at the bottom of the furnace, where it is tapped off, leaving behind pue Iron without any impurities.
                    The reason though that Iron (III) Oxide is a good choice for collecting pure Iron is because its main impurity is oxygen, of which can be easily
                    removed by mixing the compound with a commonly known, found and abundantly used substance Carbon Monoxide.
