               - Because it contains Oxygen as an impurity, combining it with Carbon Monoxide (its creation will be explained
               later on in this infographic) will remove the oxygen, leaving just pure Iron behind to be used in manufacturing
               industries.

               - Oxidized structure allows for it to have its impurities easily removed to create pure Iron.

                Method of use: <br><br>
                Iron (III) Oxide is poured into a blast furnace along with coke (pure Carbon). When this happens, once
                the furnace turns on, the hot air will combine its oxygen molecules with the Carbon to form Carbon Dioxide.
                Eventually, once enough Carbon Dioxide has formed, when the remaining Coke is poured into the furnace, it
                mixes with the created Carbon Dioxide, and reduces it to Carbon (method called 'reduction').

                The Carbon Monoxide then reacts with the Iron (III) Oxide to produce pure Iron and Carbon Dioxide gas, with Oxygen now being completely removed from the Iron.

                This newly formed Iron will then collect at the bottom of the furnace, where it is tapped off, leaving behind pure
                Iron without any impurities. The reason though that Iron (III) Oxide is a good choice for collecting
                pure Iron is because its main impurity is oxygen, of which can be easily removed by mixing the compound
                with a commonly known, found and abundantly used substance Carbon Monoxide.
